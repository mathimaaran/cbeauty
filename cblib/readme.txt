<----Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute this utility--->

This utility was written as a hobby ..
and may not give desirable outputs..
Use at your own risk..
You have been warned!!!

version 1.05 - > can handle simple C++ code and header files


Assumptions:

1. The C code Should compile .
2. The C code must not have open brace ('{') in the preprocessor portion.
3. The character '\' should not be placed in the end of any line...


The Program works in five phases..


1. It skips the preprocessor portion of the c source code
2. It removes unwanted tabs...
3. It removes unwanted spaces..
4. It inserts Newline characters at appropriate positions
5. It removes leading spaces at the start of  each line..
6. It provides indentation as required..

Limitations:

	It is not hightly customizable..
	You can easily write a C code which can make the PEcb to die :-(

For simple C codes, It really works fine.


Note:  The source code is not commented..I ll try to add comments as soon as possible..
